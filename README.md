# stack-generator

Welcome to the Tech Stack Generator.

## Motivation

This project was actually built to solve a personal problem. I participate in a few hackathons and most times I have a hard time deciding the tech stack to use. This is probably an idea issue lol but I thought, "what if I could build a CLI tool that allows me to spin up tech stacks faster?". I know there's a lot that goes into selecting a tach stack so this tool wasnt built to downplay those efforts, however it's simple a solution to a problem I HAD. Whether it's a FastAPI backend, the popular MERN stack, or Next.js + MongoDB, wouldn't it be cool to spin these resources up quickly? That way I could start & fail fast-er. That would be cool I guess

## Future Plans

I'd probably create a web app for this. Or an npm package. Honestly, not a hundred percent sure but we'll get there. But what I am going to do is open this up for others to contribute to it. So sit back and enjoy the ride!
